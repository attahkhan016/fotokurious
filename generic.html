									<h1>Generic</h1>

								<p>Photography is the process of creating still or moving pictures by recording radiation on a sensitive medium like film or an electronic sensor. The products of photography are called negatives and photographs, the latter being developed from the negatives. Light patterns reflected or emitted by objects activate a sensitive chemical or electronic sensor during a timed exposure usually through a photographic lens in a camera. The camera stores the resulting information chemically or electronically.

Photographers control the camera and lens to expose the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a latent image (on film) or raw file (in digital camera) which, after due processing, is converted to a usable image. In digital cameras, instead of film, an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive devices is used.

Photography can also be called an art and good photographers often exhibit their oeuvre like artists exhibit their paintings. In fact, the Greek word for photography means ‘drawing with light’. Photography has many applications in business, science and filmmaking, fashion, tourism, advertising, etc.</p>
								<h2>THE LAND OF HIGH PASSES</h2>
								<p>Once you travel to Ladakh you know it can’t be your last trip to Ladakh – was a lesson we learnt clearly on our first trip to this land of high passes (literally, the translation of La-dakh). This magical remote high altitude region of the Himalayas mesmerised us with its awe-inspiring barren mountains, deep blue lakes and the warmest people we have ever met.</p>

										<h3>Khardung Pass</h3>
										<p>
											Khardung La (Khardung Pass, la means pass in Tibetan) is a mountain pass in the Leh district of the Indian union territory of Ladakh. The local pronunciation is "Khardong La" or "Khardzong La" but, as with most names in Ladakh, the romanised spelling varies.
The pass on the Ladakh Range is north of Leh and is the gateway to the Shyok and Nubra valleys. The Siachen Glacier lies part way up the latter valley. Built in 1976, it was opened to public motor vehicles in 1988. Maintained by the Border Roads Organisation, the pass is strategically important to India as it is used to carry supplies to the Siachen Glacier.
The elevation of Khardung La is 5,359 m (17,582 ft).[1] Local summit signs and dozens of stores selling shirts in Leh incorrectly claim that its elevation is in the vicinity of 5,602 m (18,379 ft)} and that it is the world's highest motorable pass. But in 2013-2014, Umling La Pass(19,300 ft), which was a part of Project Himank by BRO, surpassed Khardung La in elevation to become the world's highest motorable pass.

										<h3>Pangong Lake</h3>
										<p>
											Pangong Tso or Pangong Lake (Tibetan: སྤང་གོང་མཚོ;[3] Chinese: 班公错; pinyin: Bān gōng cuò; Hindi: पैंगोंग झील) is an endorheic lake spanning eastern Ladakh and West Tibet situated at an elevation of 4,225 m (13,862 ft). It is 134 km (83 mi) long and divided into five sublakes, called Pangong Tso, Tso Nyak, Rum Tso (twin lakes) and Nyak Tso. Approximately 50% of the length of the overall lake lies within Tibet, 40% in Ladakh and the rest is disputed but controlled by China. The lake is 5 km (3.1 mi) wide at its broadest point. All together it covers 604 km2. During winter the lake freezes completely, despite being saline water. It has a land-locked basin separated from the Indus River basin by a small elevated ridge, but is believed to have been part of the latter in prehistoric times.[4]

The lake is in the process of being identified under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance. This will be the first trans-boundary wetland in South Asia under the convention.
